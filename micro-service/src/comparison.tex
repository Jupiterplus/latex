\begin{itemize}
    \item Zookeeper
    \item Consul
    \item Doozer
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Similarities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Consistent and durable general-purpose K/V store across distributed system
    \item Based on Paxos or Raft algorithm to quickly converge to a consistent state after disconnecting one of nodes
    \item Paxos vs. Raft
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{ZooKeeper vs etcd}

\begin{itemize}
    \item ZooKeeper is the oldest project from compared databases
    \item Written in Java
        \begin{itemize}
            \item ZooKeeper is more resource hungry than any other databases
        \end{itemize}
    \item ZooKeeper is more complex than etcd
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Harder to maintain
            \item It's harder to configure
        \end{itemize}
    \item ZooKeeper uses Zab
        \item implementation of Paxos
        \item Zab designed for primary-backup systems rather than for state machine replication
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Consul vs etcd}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Written in GO
    \item Consul has more high level
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Consul implements a full service discovery system in the library.
            \item DNS server interface, allowing to perform service lookups using the DNS protocol
        \end{itemize}
    \item Uses RAFT, but different implementation than etcd
    \item etcd is older than Consul
    \item HTTP+JSON based API, Curl-able
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Doozer vs. etcd}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Written in GO, created by Heroku before etcd
    \item Not developed anymore
    \item Doozer implements own Paxos algorithm
    \item Splitted into client(doozer) and server(doozerd)
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
